# Simulating a single-lane auto car wash using Discrete Event Simulation (DES)
The code used to create the simulation is found in the [carWashSimulation.py](https://github.com/ntpyxl/Single-lane-auto-car-wash-DES/blob/main/carWashSimulation.py)

### As the results will always be different from one another, the results used in the analysis from the assignment is found in:
- [Figure_1.png](https://github.com/ntpyxl/Single-lane-auto-car-wash-DES/blob/main/Figure_1.png); and
- [generated_result](https://github.com/ntpyxl/Single-lane-auto-car-wash-DES/blob/main/generated%20result.txt).txt
